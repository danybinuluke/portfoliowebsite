Outside of college and coding, I'm usually reading or writing scripts, geeking out over films (big movie buff!), or messing around with personal side projects. I like spending my free time learning at my own pace and diving into whatever catches my curiosity — whether it’s a new tech tool or a great screenplay. I’m always up for a challenge and love to learn new things. I’m passionate about using technology to solve real-world problems and am excited to see where my journey in computer science takes me next.",
